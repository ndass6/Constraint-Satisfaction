# Constraint Satisfaction
Implementation of several constraint satisfaction algorithms in Python

Contains Recursive Backtracking, Variable Selection, Value Ordering, Forward Checking, Maintaining Arc Consistency, Preprocessing (AC3), and an extra CSP problem (nQueens where n is 4).
The extra credit is located in the Extra folder. To check if the extra credit works with the code, run "python autograder.py -t ./extra/nQueens.test" in the home directory.
