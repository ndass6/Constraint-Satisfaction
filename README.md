# Constraint Satisfaction
Implementation of several constraint satisfaction algorithms in Python

Contains Recursive Backtracking, Variable Selection, Value Ordering, Forward Checking, Maintaining Arc Consistency, Preprocessing (AC3), and an extra CSP problem (nQueens where n is 4). To run the nQueens problem, run "python autograder.py -t ./extra/nQueens.test" in the home directory.
